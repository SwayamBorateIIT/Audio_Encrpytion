EE323 Digital Signal Processing

Title: Secure & Intelligent Speech Communication with Motion-Sensor Integration

Objectives
To develop a Simulink-based Android application that works on two phones(sender[phone A] and receiver[phone B]).
Recording a voice on phone A using the device microphone.
Encrypt the recorded voice signal using Frequency Scrambling with Key-Based Permutation to make it unintelligible.
Design a configurable encryption key within the application for both encryption and decryption.
Enable wireless transmission of the encrypted audio signal from phone A to phone B.
Integrate motion sensors (gyroscope and accelerometer) on phone A to capture device movement data simultaneously with the audio recording.
Time-synchronize the motion sensor data with the audio stream to allow for correlation between voice and movement patterns.
Transmit the synchronized motion data along with the encrypted audio stream.
Implement a receiving mechanism on phone B to decrypt the audio and receive the motion data.
Create a basic UI on phone B to display the received motion data in a chart or log it for analysis.
